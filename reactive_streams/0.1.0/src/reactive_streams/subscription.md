  """
  A Subscription represents a one-to-one lifecycle of a Subscriber subscribing
  to a Publisher.

  It can only be used by a single Subscriber.

  It is used to both signal desire for data and cancel demand (and allow
  resource cleanup).

  fun ref request(n: U64) =>
    """
    No events will be sent by a Publisher until demand is signaled via this
    method.

    It can be called however often and whenever neededâ€”but the outstanding
    cumulative demand must never exceed U64.max_value.

    An outstanding cumulative demand of U64.max_value may be treated by the
    Publisher as "effectively unbounded".

    Whatever has been requested can be sent by the Publisher so only signal
    demand for what can be safely handled.

    A Publisher can send less than is requested if the stream ends but then
    must emit either Subscriber.on_error or Subscriber.on_complete.

    """
    Request the Publisher to stop sending data and clean up resources.

    Data may still be sent to meet previously signalled demand after calling
    cancel as this request is asynchronous.
